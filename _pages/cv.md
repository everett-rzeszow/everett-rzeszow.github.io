Education
======
* Post-graduate degree in Marine Biology, University of Maine Orono, (expected 2024)
* B.A. in Earth and Oceanographic Science, Bowdoin College, 2021

Research experience
======
* Summer 2021- Present: *Graduate Assistant*, University of Maine, Darling Marine Center, Brady Lab
  * Designed and implementing before-after control-impact (BACI) study with mark-recapture components to determine the impact of a floating wind turbine installation on a local lobster fishery.  
  * Investigate local lobster catch metrics using GAMs.
  * Help to plan environmental and resource monitoring for the UMaine offshore wind test site.
  * Advisor: Damian Brady, PhD

* Fall 2020: *Course Trainee*, Paleoceanography, Earth and Oceanographic Studies Dept.
  * Constructed a SST proxy time series using elemental ratios from crustose coralline algae specimens collected along the  Maine coast. 
  * Compared the proxy time series to the long-running Boothbay Harbor, ME instrumental record.
  * Presented findings as a class iPoster Session at Fall AGU 2020 conference. 
  * Instructor: Michele LeVigne, PhD


* Summer 2020: *Student Researcher*, NASA Student Airborne Research Program (SARP)
  * Performed a post-hoc investigation of an enhancement in the marine volatile organic compound (VOC) trace using Whole Air Sampling (WAS) data collected by the NASA DC-8 from 2009-19.
  * Found the enhancement to be a secondary metabolite offgassed from a coastal phytoplankton bloom and temperature stressed kelp forests during the Pacific warm blob. 
  * Presented findings to a group of peers, program faculty advisors and NASA Earth Science staff. 
  * Advisor: Donald R. Blake, PhD; Alex Jarnot, PhD 

 
* Summer 2019: *Student Researcher*, Rutgers University Center for Ocean Observing Leadership (RU COOL)
  * Ran preserved Imaging FlowCytobot (IFCB) samples and filtered IFCB data from Palmer Station, Antarctica to remove detritus images.
  *  Compared biological, meteorological, and physical parameters to describe likely mechanisms controlling phytoplankton size distributions and primary productivity in the observed dataset.
  *  Presented findings as a poster at the end of the summer. 
  * Advisors: Oscar Schofield, PhD; Schuyler Nardelli, PhD
