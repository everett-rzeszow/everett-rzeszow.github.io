Hello 🤙,my name is Everett. I am a graduate student in the Brady Lab at UMaine's Darling Marine Center. My work is based in environmental and resource monitoring for offshore wind development. Specifically, I study small-scall lobster population dynamics to measure local fishery abundance. 


I hope you enjoy this journey.
