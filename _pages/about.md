Hello, my name is Everett Rzeszowski. I am a graduate student in UMaine's School of Marine Sciences based out of the Darling Marine Center in ME's Center for Sustainable Coastal Resources. 

My past work has focused on resource monitoring for offshore wind development. Specifically, I have designed and implemented a commercial trapping survey to study small-scall lobster population dynamics to measure local fishery abundance in pre-construction periods. Currently, I am working on sensitivity analyses for models developed from this survey; SDMs for lobster SSB; investigating connectivity of historic Stock Units and growth observation error using tagging data; and planning a pilot Blue crab trapping survey.

Thank you for checking me out. Personal statement to come here soon...
