This past fall I spent 6 weeks on Monhegan Island (Oct. 8- Nov. 21) performing a commercial trapping survey with the help of local lobstermen to assess both population dynamics and catch metrics in the local fishery. In the survey 72 lobster traps were fished between two sites, Test and Control, for 36 traps/ site. 

The fall survey was the first iteration of a Before-After Control-Impact (BACI) study to investigate whether or not the installation and operation of the western hemisphere's first commercial scale floating wind turbine will create a measurable impact on the local lobster fishery. Future blog posts will delve further into the approach behind the survey itself.

This spring I'll be returning to Monhegan Island from April 18- May 20/ 27 for the second iteration (first spring season) of the survey. 

Updates to come as the survey gets underway.
