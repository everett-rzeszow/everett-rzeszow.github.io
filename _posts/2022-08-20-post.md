Tomorrow I'll be presenting the preliminary results from the basline commercial trapping survey at the American Fisheries Society annual meeting in Spokane, WA! It was a big push to get the data analysis to a point that it was presentation ready and then to actually create a presentation. The pre-recorded version of the presentation [can be viewed here](https://youtu.be/JA_v9K7x-yk). The session is on **Offshore wind and fishery interactions** and I'm excited to see what sorts of thoughts people are having on the west coast about devveloping offshore wind energy and whether they are finding that lessons learned from east coast fixed-bottom wnd infrastructure ecological monitoring, siting and leasing problems is applicable to the floating-wind future they expect.
