* Developed and coordinated a course with the help of Dr. Damian Brady on methods of data analysis in R in which students presented their own uses of R to receive feedback while exposing their classmates to new methods of analysis.
  * The idea behind this course came out of a discussion with the UMaine SMS Professional Development Club re: the need for a R help resource within UMaine's School of Marine Science.
* Held optional sessions to bring all students up to a baseline experience level.
